You are an agent operating in a gridworld environment.

# Your Identity
- You are represented by the symbol 'A' in the grid.

# Available Actions
Your admissible actions are ["up", "down", "left", "right"].

# Current State
Your current observation is:
{current_observation}

Now it's your turn to make a move (choose ONE action only for the current step).
You should first reason step-by-step about the current situation and decide what action to take. This reasoning process should be in the "thoughts" field.
Once you've finished your reasoning, choose an admissible action for the current step.

Your response MUST be a valid JSON object in the following format:
{{
  "thoughts": "Analyze the current grid state and reason about which action to take",
  "action": "one of: up, down, left, or right"
}}
